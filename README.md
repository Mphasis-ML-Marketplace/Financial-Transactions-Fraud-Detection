# Financial-Transactions-Fraud-Detection
This solution is a deep learning based algorithm capable of training on transactional data, to identify spurious transactions.

## Product overview

This solution is a deep learning-based approach to learn and understand the patterns in financial transaction data. It aims at learning the normal behavior patterns of the transactions during the training process using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm. Once trained, the model can identify abnormal patterns of transactions, thereby classifying them as anomalous.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be used to identify transactions that are spurious given the usual transaction pattern of the customer. Identified spurious transactions can be flagged to the customer or blocked. This solution can be used by Banks, Credit Card Issuers etc.

* Data imbalance is a major challenge in the anomaly detection domain, with huge non-fraud data and limited fraudulent data. This solution uses a semi-supervised approach based generative deep learning model to learn normal transaction patterns using non-fraudulent data and then builds a 1-rule threshold model using data from both classes to identify the anomalous transactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The solution is also re-trainable to capture information drift.

* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need Customized Deep learning and Machine Learning Solutions? Get in Touch!
